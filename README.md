# Smart-parking
 The "Smart Parking using OpenCV and Image Processing with Python" project aims to automate the process of monitoring and managing parking spaces using computer vision techniques. 
The Smart Parking Spot  project utilizes image processing techniques with OpenCV in Python to analyze parking lot images. The process involves annotating parking spots using the `annotateSpot` Python script. This script allows users to specify parking spots by creating rectangles or shapes around each spot. Once the spots are annotated, the main script, `main.py`, is executed to perform spot detection and occupancy monitoring. The system analyzes the annotated spots and determines their occupancy status using image processing techniques such as adaptive thresholding and the count non-zero function. This approach provides a simple and efficient solution for detecting parking spot occupancy in real-time, enhancing the overall parking management experience.
